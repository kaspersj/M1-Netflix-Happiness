## Description

Netflix offers services in 190 countries globally has played a big role in our mental health, especially when the COVID-19 pandemic began shutting down the world. In 2020 and 2021, people generally spent less waking time outside. With less time out of the house, Netflix subscriber base increased by multiple folds with the world united with one common pastime - binge watching Netflix content, a way of self-care to relax and de-stress. In October 2020, Netflix revised its pricing. Further on January 14, 2022, Netflix revised its pricing again for some countries. Netflix Price is different for each country. We wanted to investigate Netflix Pricing related data to see what factors may have helped Netflix's marketing determine pricing for each country. We wanted to see if there is correlation between Pricing with Netflix Library size, and whether there are key country development factors unique to each country which correlate to Netflix Pricing. We wanted to stretch this analysis further by analyzing if Happiness Score, compiled by Gallup World Poll data (which uses global survey data to report how people evaluate their own lives in more than 150 countries) has any correlation with Netflix Price
